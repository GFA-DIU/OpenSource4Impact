# Costs and financing

In this section, we will discuss some of the financial aspects which are important to as you prepare an manage an open source project.

## A first cost overview

In general we can divide the cost into four major categories:

- **Staff**: The staff includes the people working on the project like developers, testers, Q&A and others, their travel etc.
- **Hardware**: The hardware that is needed to get the whole project also running.
- **Administration**: Who is working behind the scences to get the non-technical questions resolved ?
- **Licences**: It is fairly likely that you will have some licence costs (working on open-source or not).

Then it is also helfpul to separate  the costs into a first build and roll-out / run.

## Details on staff positions

In the following section we provide a more detailled list that might help you to estimate the initial costs of the build phase.

### Key Experts

| Role                | Tasks Within Role |

| Project Managers    | - Oversee the planning and coordination of the project<br>- Manage timelines and resources<br>- Ensure project objectives and milestones are met   |
| System Architects/Engineers | - Design the system infrastructure<br>- Select appropriate hardware<br>- Plan for initial scalability improvements                            |
| Software Developers | - Customize the open-source software<br>- Develop necessary integrations and initial feature enhancements                                      |
| Business Analysts   | - Conduct market research and feasibility studies<br>- Gather system requirements                                                                |

### Other experts, depending on the scope and complexity of the project

| Role                    | Tasks Within Role                                                                   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| IT Security Specialists | - Ensure the implementation meets security standards                                |
| Database Administrators (DBAs) | - Set up databases and ensure data integrity                                      |
| Network Engineers       | - Configure necessary network infrastructure                                        |
| Training Coordinators   | - Plan and organize initial training sessions                                       |
| Risk Managers           | - Conduct initial risk assessment<br>- Develop contingency plans                    |

Within the run phase, you might also consider the following positions.

| Job Role | Responsibilities |
|----------|------------------|
| IT Support Staff/Help Desk | Provide ongoing user support and troubleshooting. |
| System Administrators | Perform regular system maintenance, apply updates and patches. |
| Network Administrators | Ensure network reliability and performance. |
| Database Administrators (DBAs) | Maintain database integrity and performance. |
| Data Center Administrators | Oversee server operations, manage infrastructure. |
| Cloud Services Administrators | Manage and monitor cloud-based resources and services. |
| Security Analysts | Monitor for security breaches, conduct assessments. |
| Compliance Officers | Ensure compliance with regulations, manage audits. |
| Technical Trainers | Deliver ongoing training on software updates and features. |
| Project Managers (for ongoing projects) | Coordinate projects related to the software. |
| Risk Managers | Monitor and assess risks, develop mitigation strategies. |

### Backstopping

The backstopping structure is designed to provide a support system for both key roles and other experts involved in the project. It ensures that specialized knowledge and leadership are always available, minimizing the impact of any individual's temporary absence. This structure is particularly important for maintaining progress and quality in projects that require a high level of expertise and coordination. The actual scope of the backstopping structure depends on the specific project, its complexity and critical elements, and will be specified in the terms of reference for the specific project.
