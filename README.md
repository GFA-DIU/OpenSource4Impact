# OpenSource4Impact

[![Built with Material for MkDocs](https://img.shields.io/badge/Material_for_MkDocs-526CFE?style=for-the-badge&logo=MaterialForMkDocs&logoColor=white)](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)


Welcome to the *Open Source guideline for Development Cooperation projects*. This repository contains all the source files behind the guideline. It is designed to help people working in development cooperation to:

  - Take a well-informed decision for or against the use, introduction or development of open source tools 
  - Avoid late failure and unexpected cost through appropiate planning

It is written from the perspective of practitioners working in publicly funded development cooperation projects and organizations. We wish for that it might make a contribution towards more successful open source endeavors and more sustainable digital solutions in general.

## Contributing

This project would like to provide a welcoming place to learn from the various experiences on implementing open source projects within development cooperation. We therefore welcome different **types of contributions**, most of them don't require you to write a single line of code.

If you're looking for a way to contribute, you can scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/GFA-DIU/GFA-DIU.github.io/issues) for something to work on. 

For more complex contributions, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/GFA-DIU/GFA-DIU.github.io/issues) to describe the changes you'd like to see.
